### getting started

1. if you don't have python installed in your machine [download now](https://www.python.org/)

2. This bot uses Selenium Webdriver so download selenium and the webdriver (I used for chrome v80 if you use other download and put on project's folder) [For chrome](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), [firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

3. after you do all the steps u need to do this simple code changes 
   ```
      globo_email = ''  #your globo email
      globo_pass = ''   # your globo password

      driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='path/to/driver') 
      
      # here you need to find a driver to your browser
      # and where is written Chrome you need to change to your browser driver
   ```
4. Enjoy it!
